                    <p class="mb-3">Imam Ahmad Raza Khan was born on Saturday afternoon, 10th Shawwal, 1272 AH (14th June 1856) in Bareilly, a city in what is now Uttar Pradesh, India. He was born into a family of notable Islamic scholars. His father, Mawlana Naqi Ali Khan, was a renowned scholar and his grandfather, Mawlana Raza Ali Khan, was also a prominent Islamic jurist.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-3">His grandfather named him "Al-Mukhtar," but he later became known as Ahmad Raza. The honorific "Ala Hazrat" (meaning "Grand Master") was a title of respect that became so associated with him that it is now synonymous with his name.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-3">His family traced their lineage to the Barech tribe of Pathans who had migrated from Qandahar, Afghanistan to India. His ancestors had held important positions in the Mughal Empire before withdrawing from worldly affairs to focus on religious scholarship.</p>

                            <p>Imam Ahmad Raza Khan was a master of abjad, a numeral system in which each letter of the alphabet is assigned a value. He used this system to create chronograms for events and as titles for his books, such that when the letters are added using the abjad system, they tally with the year in which the work was written.</p>

                            <p>Even in technical works, his prose exhibits rhetorical excellence, utilizing literary devices like metaphor, analogy, and rhythmic patterns to enhance clarity and impact. His refutations of heretical views, in particular, display eloquent argumentation combined with powerful rhetorical effect.</p>

His poetic style has influenced generations of Urdu poets, and his devotional compositions remain fixtures in religious gatherings.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">Literary scholars acknowledge his contribution to enriching Islamic literature with works that combine traditional devotional themes with innovative stylistic techniques. His ability to express complex theological concepts in accessible, moving poetry has helped popularize Islamic teachings among masses.</p>
                    
                    <p>Perhaps the most enduring aspect of his literary legacy is how his devotional poems, particularly the Salam, have become integral to Sunni Muslim identity in South Asia and diaspora communities worldwide, recited daily in mosques, homes, and gatherings as expressions of love for the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.</p>
